# Release Notes


# OMPL.app 0.15.0 (??)

- Added many new planners:
  - [Linear Temporal Logical Planner (LTLPlanner)](\ref cLTLPlanner): a planner that find solutions for motion planning problems where the goal is specified by a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specification.
  - [Fast Marching Tree algorithm (FMT∗)](\ref gFMT): a new asymptotically optimal algorithm contributed by Marco Pavone's Autonomous Systems Laboratory at Stanford.
  - [Coupled Forest of Random Engrafting Search Trees (CForest)](\ref gCForest): a meta-planner that runs several instances of asymptotically optimal planners in different threads. When one thread finds a better solution path, the states along the path are passed on to the other threads.
  - [Anytime Path Shortening](\ref gAPS): a generic wrapper around one or more geometric motion planners that repeatedly applies [shortcutting](\ref ompl::geometric::PathSimplifier) and [hybridization](\ref ompl::geometric::PathHybridization) to a set of solution paths. Any number and combination of planners can be specified, each is run in a separate thread.
- RRT* has a new option to periodically prune parts of the tree that are guaranteed *not* to contain the optimal solution. This idea was introduced in CForest, but it useful independently of the CForest parallelization. Although pruning is almost always useful, it is *disabled* by default to preserve the original behavior.
- Created consistent behavior across all planners that can optimize paths. Calls to the solve method of RRT*, PRM*, SPARS, SPARStwo, and LBTRRT will terminate when (1) the planner termination condition is true or (2) the optimization objective is satisfied. To make these planners terminate when *any* solution is found, you can set the cost threshold for the optimization objective to, e.g., OptimizationObjective::infiniteCost(). For most of these planners, asymptotic (approximate) optimality is only guaranteed when using the PathLengthOptimizationObjective class.
- Most control-based planners can now use steering functions. The user simply needs to override ompl::control::StatePropagator::steer() and ompl::control::StatePropagator::canSteer() in a derived class.
- Several improvements to benchmarking functionality:
  - [Planner Arena](http://plannerarena.org) has been relaunched and can be used to interactively visualize benchmark results.
  - The config files for ompl_benchmark and the OMPL.app GUI can now be used to specify control-based problems and optimization objectives.
- Updated Py++ toolchain. If you previously installed Py++ and have trouble generating the OMPL Python bindings, you may need to run "make installpyplusplus" again.
- Bug fixes.


# OMPL.app 0.14.2 (May 23, 2014)

- Changed the [benchmark database schema](\ref benchmark_database) to make it easier to create your own plots.
- Real-valued state components are now also stored when exporting PlannerData objects in [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org) format.
- Bug fixes.
- Documentation fixes.
- New menu option in the OMPL.app GUI to save the roadmap/tree created by a planner in GraphML format.
- Update FCL bindings to be compatible with FCL 0.3.0.


# OMPL.app 0.14.1 (January 23, 2014)

- Update PlannerData to use new cost infrastructure.
- Bug fixes.


# OMPL.app 0.14.0 (December 20, 2013)

- Added new cost infrastructure to plan optimal paths with respect to arbitrary cost functions. Several common cost objective functions have been defined (such as path length and mechanical work) and new ones can easily be defined.
- RRT*, PRM*, TRRT, and PRM have been updated to use this cost infrastructure.
- BallTreeRRT* has been removed since it assumed that the path cost is equal to the path length.
- Added two new planners:
    - [Lower Bound Tree RRT (LBTRRT)](\ref gLBTRRT), a near asymptotically-optimal incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithm.
    - [Search Tree with Resolution Independent Density Estimation (STRIDE)](\ref gSTRIDE), an EST-like planner that uses an extension of the GNAT nearest neighbor data structure that supports sampling states inversely proportional to the density of previously sampled states.
- Added support for MORSE. Through a plugin you can use OMPL with Blender and MORSE to plan kinodynamic paths. See [the gallery](gallery.html) for some examples.
- Added functionality to the Benchmark class to keep track of user-specified properties at regular intervals. This is especially useful for asymptotically/approximately optimal or anytime planners.
- Added more [demo programs](group__demos.html).
- Added several new planning problems for use with the GUI and ompl_benchmark program.
- Updated gccxml snapshot. If you use gcc 4.8 and the OMPL Python bindings, you need to run "make installpyplusplus" again.
- Bug fixes.


# OMPL.app 0.13.0 (August 5, 2013)

- Added several new planners:
    - [SPARS](\ref gSPARS) and [SPARS2](\ref gSPARStwo) are roadmap-based planners that operate similarly to Visibility-based PRM, but provide asymptotic near-optimality guarantees.
    - Path-Directed Subdivision Tree (PDST). There are actually two versions: [one for geometric planning](\ref gPDST) and [one for control-based planning](\ref cPDST).
    - [Lazy PRM](\ref gLazyPRM), a variant that lazily evaluates the validity of nodes and edges in a roadmap.
- Various improvements and bug fixes in the RRTstar and BallTreeRRTstar planners.
- Various optimizations in the Syclop planner.
- The Syclop planner can now operate over triangular decompositions. This is enabled if the [triangle](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html) package is installed.
- Significantly reworked and extended unit tests for planning algorithms.
- Added method to extract a ompl::base::StateStorage object from ompl::base::PlannerData.
- State spaces can indicate whether they are metric.
- Certain path shortcutting techniques are disabled for non-metric state spaces during path simplification.
- Extended ProblemDefinition API to support path optimizing planners.
- Added printAsMatrix method to ompl::geometric::PathGeometric and ompl::control::PathControl to facilitate plotting of paths. Added a [tutorial on path visualization](pathVisualization.html).
- The path format produced by the printAsMatrix method is also used by the [OMPL.app GUI](gui.html).
- Added more [demo programs](group__demos.html).
- Use the officially released version of [OdeInt](http://www.boost.org/libs/numeric/odeint) that comes with Boost 1.53 for numerical integration. The bundled version of OdeInt is not used or installed if the user has Boost >= 1.53 installed.
- Updated Py++ toolchain (gccxml, pygccxml, pyplusplus). If you use gcc 4.7/4.8 or Boost 1.54, you need to run "make installpyplusplus" again.
- Various fixes for Python 3.x. The python bindings and GUI can now be used with Python 3.x.
- Bug fixes.

- Stricter checking for FCL and CCD versions, to avoid link problems with ROS Fuerte.
- Bug fixes.


# OMPL.app 0.12.0 (November 20, 2012)

- Added representation of costs to ompl::base::StateValidityChecker.
- Added the notion of objectives to be optimized: ompl::base::OptimizationObjective.

# OMPL.app 0.11.1 (July 26, 2012)

- Fixed bug in RRT* where nearest neighbor radius shrinks too fast.

- Added support for Assimp 3 (Assimp 2 is still supported as well).
- Bug and documentation fixes.


# OMPL.app 0.11.0 (June 30, 2012)

- PlannerData now uses the Boost Graph Library (BGL). This offers much more flexibility and power in the inspection of planner data structures. Rather than storing only the data common to all planners, each planner can store its own (meta)data per vertex and edge in a graph. All graph algorithms that exists in BGL can be applied directly.
- Added PlannerDataStorage object for serialization/deserialization of PlannerData
- Logging mechanism is now using macros instead of the msg::Interface class. The file name and line number where a message originated is printed out for every message type.
- Changed the return type for Planner::solve from bool to an enumeration (base::PlannerStatus).  This allows for more refined failure/success reporting.  A cast to bool exists for a quick success check.
- Added serialization for controls and a signature for the control space.
- Moved solution paths from Goal to ProblemDefinition.
- Implementation of PRM is now threaded (one thread for growing the roadmap, one thread for monitoring whether the problem is solved).
- Improvements to sampleUniformNear() for SO3.
- Options were added to the benchmark configuration file syntax to save solution paths. Either all paths, no paths, or the shortest path can be saved.
- A TeamCity Continuous Integration server has been set up at http://teamcity.kavrakilab.org.
- The public repository, issue tracker, and downloads have been moved to Bitbucket. Sourceforge is being phased out for these services.
- Reduced dependencies: GTest has been replaced by Boost Test, subversion and CVS are no longer needed to get some optional dependencies.
- Bug fixes.


# OMPL.app 0.10.2 (March 21, 2012)

- Created a blog to highlight new features.
- Added support for multi-robot rigid-body motion planning.
- Updated FCL (which now uses FLANN instead of ANN for nearest neighbors)
- Bug fixes.


# OMPL.app 0.10.1 (February 27, 2012)

- Added representation of discrete control spaces.
- Fixes for XCode 4.3 when compiling the Python bindings.
- Updates to support Python 3.x in existing demo programs.

- Bug fixes.


# OMPL.app 0.10.0 (February 16, 2012)

- Minimum Boost version is now 1.44.
- Added a primer on sampling-based motion planning and OMPL.
- Added an implementation of SyCLoP, a new multilayered meta-planner that combines discrete search with a sampling-based motion planner. Implementations of Syclop with RRT and EST as the low-level planners are provided.
- Added an implementation of EST for planning with controls.
- New generic interface for parameter settings for almost anything that is user-configurable. This was done to simplify reading parameters from an input file (see next bullet).
- New benchmark program that allows one to easily specify benchmark problems with simple configuration files.
- New state spaces for Dubins vehicles and Reeds-Shepp vehicles. This allows one to use any geometric planner to compute feasible paths for such vehicles. See the demo program demo_GeometricCarPlanning.
- Added state serialization, deserialization, state space signatures.
- Added the notion of DirectedControlSampler.
- Added path hybridization, a technique for combining several solutions to a motion planning query to form a better bath. We also introduced a utility class called ParallelPlan that runs several planner instances in parallel and (optionally) uses path hybridization.
- Added a more advanced path shortcutting method.
- Added support for FCL collision checking library. PQP is actually still faster, and is therefore still the default.
- All versions of EST and SBL use the new PDF class to sample more efficiently from empirical probability distribution functions.
- Added a wrapper for boost::numeric::odeint to support high-order numerical integration of ordinary differential equations.
- Fixed issues with static variables for console.
- Added RPY sampling to the RNG class.
- Made some public members protected for GoalState and GoalStates; improvements to GoalLazySamples.
- Added support for multiple solution paths in a Goal datastructure.
- Added StateSpace::getValueAddressAtLocation() to allow faster indexing in states using state space names.
- The C++ code switched to the preferred boost::function syntax. A general method for exposing boost::function objects to Python was added, but this requires a patch to pygccxml.
- To make installing and patching Py++, pygccml, and gccxml easier there is now a script called installPyPlusPlus.sh that does this. One can call this script after running cmake by typing “make installpyplusplus”.


# OMPL.app 0.9.5 (October 4, 2011)

- Added control sampler functions that allow specifying an intended direction of propagation
- Made python, Boost.Python, PyOpenGL, and PyQt optional; the omplapp library is useful even without the GUI or python bindings.
- Removed pre-generated Python binding code. It turns out that they are dependent on the particular Boost version.
- Bug fixes.


# OMPL.app 0.9.4 (August 16, 2011)

- Renamed StateManifold to StateSpace and ControlManifold to ControlSpace
- Added RRTstar contribution
- Added GNAT nearest neighbors datastructure

- Added isStraightLinePathValid() to PlannerDefinition
- Using boost ublas for real vector projections
- Add sanity checks for state spaces
- Benchmarked planners are now run in a separate thread (and termination conditions are evaluated separately, to detect crashes)
- Added getType() for Goal and replaced getType() for planners by getSpecs()
- Generalized planner termination conditions. The user can now call terminate() at any time to signal a planner it should stop its computation
- Improvements to control::KPIECE1, so that it considers goal biasing more appropriately
- Move code for extracting machine properties from util/ to benchmark/
- Documentation fixes

- Bug fixes for planning with controls
- Minor doc improvements


# OMPL.app 0.9.1 (December 17, 2010)

- Minor updates to build system

# OMPL.app 0.9.0 (December 15, 2010; initial release)

- Implementations of many state-of-the-art sampling-based motion planning algorithms. For purely geometric planning, there are implementations of KPIECE, SBL, RRT, RRT Connect, EST, PRM, Lazy RRT, and others. For planning with differential constraints there are implementations of KPIECE and RRT. Addition of new planners poses very few constraints on the added code.
- A flexible mechanism for constructing arbitrarily complex configuration spaces and control spaces from simpler ones.
- A general method of defining goals: as states, as regions in configuration space, or implicitly.
- Various sampling strategies and an easy way to add other ones.
- Automatic selection of reasonable default parameters. Performance can be improved by tuning parameters, but solutions can be obtained without setting any parameters.
- GUI for rigid body motion planning.
- Support for planning with the Open Dynamics Engine, a popular physics simulator.
- Tools for systematic, large-scale benchmarking.
