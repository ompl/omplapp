Steps to release a new version:
* update release notes (releaseNotes.md for both ompl and omplapp; put date, features)
* update version number in package.xml and CMakeLists.txt `package(...)` commands in omplapp and ompl dir
* "git pull" in omplapp and ompl
* "git clean -fd" in omplapp and ompl
* build omplapp with bindings
* build ompl without bindings
* make test for both
* run ompl_app.py and solve a test problem
* make install
* make docker-omplapp docker-ompl docker-plannerarena.
    - do this for every docker image:
        docker tag ompl:x.y.z kavrakilab/ompl:x.y.z
        docker push kavrakilab/ompl:x.y.z
    - pull new docker images on omplapp.kavrakilab.org/plannerarena.org and restart web services
* make package_source for omplapp, since github tagged release doesn't include ompl submodule
* make website for omplapp to update web site repo (assumed to exist in ${HOME}/src/ompl.github.io)
* "jekyll build" in the ompl blog repo, copy content in _site/* to ${HOME}/src/ompl.github.io
* commit and push ${HOME}/src/ompl.github.io
* tag omplapp, ompl, ompl.github.io with version number x.y.z (including patch level this time)
* update ompl in various package managers:
    - ROS: https://github.com/ros-gbp/ompl-release
        bloom-release ompl -r noetic -t noetic
    - Macports: https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/tree/master/science/ompl
    - HomeBrew: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/ompl.rb
    - vcpkg: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/ompl
* update dependencies for these package managers as needed: fcl, libccd, flann, ode, castxml, py-pygccxml, py-pyplusplus, etc.
* push changes to ompl and omplapp repos on github. Create releases for both, include release notes, attach omplapp-Source-x.y.z.tar.gz for omplapp (output of `make package_source`)
* update version on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMPL
* announce on ompl-users@lists.sourceforge.net, robot-motion@mit.edu
* after release update version in CMakeLists.txt, ompl/CMakeLists.txt
    - also increment ABI version if needed (if previously existing API has changed)
