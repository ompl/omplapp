Steps to release a new version:
* update release notes (releaseNotes.dox for both ompl and omplapp; put date, features)
* update version in ompl/CMakeModules/OMPLVersion.cmake
    - also increment ABI version if needed (if previously existing API has changed)
* hg pull -u in omplapp and ompl
* hg purge in omplapp and ompl
* build omplapp with bindings
* build ompl without bindings
* make test for both
* run ompl_app.py and solve a test problem
* make install
* make package_source
* upload to bitbucket.org
* make website for both omplapp and ompl (to update ompl-beta.kavrakilab.org)
* change "BRANCH=trunk" below to "BRANCH=release-x.y" (no patch level) and do make website for both omplapp and ompl. Undo these changes afterwards (do not commit)
* make sure the symlink /mnt/data2/ompl/release on arachne points to the latest release-x.y (no patch level)
* tag omplapp and ompl with version number x.y.z (including patch level this time)
* update MacPorts port files (ask someone with a mac or file a ticket on trac.macports.org) for ompl, fcl, libccd, flann, ode, gccxml-devel, py-pygccxml-devel, py-pyplusplus-devel and other possible dependencies.
* push changes to ompl and omplapp repos on bitbucket:
    - in the folders that contains the private clone of ompl, execute this command:
      hg push -b default ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/ompl/ompl
    - do the same for the omplapp repo
* announce to ompl-users@lists.sourceforge.net
